/// Instantiated objects can be easily transferred from one channel to another.
/// The most obvious usage for this would be moving player avatars or NPCs from one region to another.
/// If a player is present in the region the object gets transferred to, they won't see any changes.
/// If the player is not present, the object will simply act as if it was destroyed. For players
/// that are present in the region it's transferred to that are not present in the region the object
/// was transferred from, the object will simply be created and all of its RFCs will be executed
/// as if it was loaded from a save file.
